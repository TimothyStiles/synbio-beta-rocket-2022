				<!-- A refreshening modern take on synbio software that everyone can love -->
				
				<!-- written in Go with 98.6% test coverage -->
				
				<!-- documentation that's guaranteed to never break -->

				<!-- readable codebase -->

				<!-- design primers, fix oligos for synthesis, optimize codons, parse files, simulate Golden Gate cloning and much more with reliability and speed-->

				<!-- literally will cut your AWS bill by 25X -->
				
				<!-- your dev team will have time to work on cool stuff and you won't have to hire people to write basic shit -->

				<!-- it just works. I've never had to help someone install Poly. No wasted time messing around with dev environments and docker -->

				<!-- More features coming -->

				<!-- adopt and contribute to poly so instead of synbio becoming this -->
				<!-- running out of Krusty Krab screaming meme -->

				<!-- it becomes this -->

				<section>wtf</section>

				<section>begin building more</section>

				<section>everything is super tested (97% code coverage)</section>
